Changes to BC and behavior in version 5.4
=========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

  With the implementation of this new feature, a new option has been introduced
  for the user HashType, the bcrypt. This new option will encrypt the user password
  using bcrypt algorithm.
  Caution - Using the PASSWORD_BCRYPT, will result in the password parameter 
  being truncated to a maximum length of 72 characters

Change of behavior
------------------

- EZP-23296: Template Block Cache has cache key collisions

  The template cache blocks where using crc32 which has a high probability of collisions.
  Feature has been changed to use md5 like viewcache already uses.

  Note: To avoid that you have to many cache blocks take advantage of putting identical once in
  own template so they will share cache (template and location of block is part of internal unique key).

- EZP-26028: Unable to use Online Editor when using PHP7

  To fix this issue, first parameter of all XML input and output handlers, `$xmlData` can not be a reference anymore.


Removed features

  This drastically decreases the size of the database for huge sites.
