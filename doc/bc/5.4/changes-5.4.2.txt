Changes to BC and behavior in version 5.4
=========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

- EZP-23725: Wrong path_identification_string when editing in frontend siteaccess using PathPrefix and RootNode

  As of 5.4.2/5.3.5 a new setting has been introduced, content.ini/[NodeSettings]/SiteNode
  It is a better fit use cases of defining root of your frontend site content root and is from now on the recommended
  way over setting RootNode to something else then the actual Content root of the global repository.
