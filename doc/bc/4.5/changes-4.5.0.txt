Changes to BC and behavior in version 4.5.0
===========================================

Removed features
----------------

- Content views "diff" and "versions" have been removed.

  They have been deprecated in 3.9 in favor of the combined view "history".


Removed globals
---------------

- eZINIGlobalInstance-*

  eZINI now uses a protected static variable to keep track of eZINI instances.
  Use eZINI::resetAllGlobals( false ); to clear them if needed.
