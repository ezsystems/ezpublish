Changes to BC and behavior in version 5.3
=========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------


Change of behavior
------------------

- Fix EZP-16372: deleting of content lasts very long

  The prototypes of eZSearch::removeObject() and eZSearch::removeObjectById() have changed :

  static function removeObject( $contentObject, $commit = true )
  becomes
  static function removeObject( $contentObject, $commit = null )

  This change is needed to make ezfind.ini[IndexOptions]\DisableDeleteCommits option of eZFind actually work.

- Debug messages triggered by eZDebug::write* now consistently contain the method names in which they were triggered.

  If you rely on the previously static labels, e.g. for log parsing, please consider adapting your parsers.
