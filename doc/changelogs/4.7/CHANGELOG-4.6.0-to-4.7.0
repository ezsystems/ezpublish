Changes from 4.6.0 to 4.7.0

*Kernel:

*Design:

*eZTemplate:

*eZLocale:
- All share/locale/*.ini\[HTTP]\ContentLanguage have been checked and updated

- httpLocaleCode() can now only return a code X-Y, with:
  X an iso 639-1 language code (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
  Y an iso 3166-1-alpha2 country code (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)

- site.ini\[RegionalSettings]\HTTPLocale must be an X-Y as explained just above, if you use this setting.
  However, you should not use anymore this setting, as it was intended to be used when an http locale is wrong,
  which can't be the case now, as all http locales in share/locale/*.ini have been checked and updated
