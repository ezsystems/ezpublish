=======================
Asynchronous publishing
=======================

Synopsis
========

This feature enables content publishing to be made through a queue that gives complete control over the amount of
concurrent publishing operations. The goal is to make the database load manageable and avoid timeouts.

Setting it up
=============

eZ Publish settings
-------------------
The feature is disabled by default. To enable it, content.ini must be overriden, and the following block must be added
to the override file::

    [PublishingSettings]
    AsynchronousPublishing=enabled

By default, up to 10 concurrent publishing operations will be allowed. If you want to change this, another INI setting
must be added to the override::

    [PublishingSettings]
    AsynchronousPublishing=disabled
    PublishingProcessSlots=20

System configuration
--------------------
Publishing operations are handled by a system daemon. This daemon must be running, or content just won't be published.

Manual execution
''''''''''''''''
The daemon can be started manually by running the following, as your webserver user::

    ezroot$ php bin/php/publishingqueueprocessor.php

The script will run interactively. To start it in daemon mode (so that it actually detaches from the current session and
will keep running even if you log out), the -n flag can be added::

    ezroot$ php bin/php/publishingqueueprocessor.php -n

init scripts
''''''''''''
This is the method that we recommend on production. Standard init.d scripts for debian and redhat are provided, and can
be used to have the daemon started on boot.

First, the startup script for your system must be linked to your init.d folder. This is an example for debian::

    cd /etc/init.d
    ln -s /path/to/ezpublish/bin/startup/debian/asynchronous-publishing ./asynchronous-publishing
    chmod +x ./asynchronous-publishing

The daemon can therefore be started using::

    /etc/init.d/asynchronous-publishing start

It can also be stopped or restarted using the same script, by replacing start with stop or restart.
