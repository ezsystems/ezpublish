=======================
Asynchronous publishing
=======================

Synopsis
========

This feature enables content publishing to be made through a queue that gives complete control over the amount of
concurrent publishing operations. The goal is to make the database load manageable and avoid timeouts.

Setting it up
=============

eZ Publish settings
-------------------
The feature is disabled by default. To enable it, content.ini must be overriden, and the following block must be added
to the override file::

    [PublishingSettings]
    AsynchronousPublishing=enabled

By default, up to 10 concurrent publishing operations will be allowed. If you want to change this, another INI setting
must be added to the override::

    [PublishingSettings]
    AsynchronousPublishing=disabled
    PublishingProcessSlots=20

System configuration
--------------------
Publishing operations are handled by a system daemon. This daemon must be running, or content just won't be published.

Manual execution
''''''''''''''''
The daemon can be started manually by running the following, as your webserver user::

    ezroot$ php bin/php/ezasynchronouspublisher.php

The script will run interactively. To start it in daemon mode (so that it actually detaches from the current session and
will keep running even if you log out), the -n flag can be added::

    ezroot$ php bin/php/ezasynchronouspublisher.php -n

init scripts
''''''''''''
This is the method that we recommend on production. Standard init.d scripts for debian and redhat are provided, and can
be used to have the daemon started on boot.

First, the startup script for your system must be *linked* to your init.d folder. This is an example for debian::

    cd /etc/init.d
    ln -s /path/to/ezpublish/bin/startup/debian/ezasynchronouspublisher ./ezasynchronouspublisher
    chmod +x ./ezasynchronouspublisher

The daemon can therefore be started using::

    /etc/init.d/ezasynchronouspublisher start

It can also be stopped or restarted using the same script, by replacing start with stop or restart.

Settings
''''''''
The init scripts come with default settings that should match most platforms. If for some reason, your webserver user
isn't the platform's default and/or if your PHP CLI executable isn't part of your webserver user's PATH, you can
customize these.

First, copy the default configuration file for your platform to the correct directory for your OS:
- RHEL: /etc/ezasynchronouspublisher.conf
- Debian: /etc/default/ezasynchronouspublisher.conf

Example for Debian/Ubuntu::
    $ cp bin/startup/debian/ezasynchronouspublisher.defaults /etc/default/ezasynchronouspublisher.conf

Then edit this file, uncommenting and set the required variables to the required values as according to the comments
in the settings file.

Multiple instances
------------------

One database per instance
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
If you need to run multiple publishing daemons, you just need to create one symlink per daemon instance. The init.d
script name will be used as the PID file's name, and both will be independant. Note that multiple daemons on one instance
with multiple DBs aren't yet supported.

One instance with multiple databases
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
As for multiple instances with one database each, you must in any case create one startup script per database.

One extra step is then required to configure each init.d script. By default, the daemon will use the default siteaccess
settings. Since this situation involves multiple databases, an explicit siteaccess name must be used. To configure the
siteaccess each daemon should use, an extra file must be created.

Each daemon can be assigned a siteaccess by creating a configuration file named::

    /etc/default/ezasynchronouspublisher/<init.d name>.conf

Example for an init.d script named ``/etc/init.d/myezdaemon`` ::

    /etc/default/ezasynchronouspublisher/myezdaemon.conf

This file currently supports one setting named siteaccess::

    SITEACCESS=plain_site_admin

Customization
=============

Filtering hooks
---------------

The asynchronous publishing system comes with filtering hooks that can easily be implemented in order to prevent items
from being published asynchronously.

You can configure as many filters as you want, as PHP classes. Each filter will be called sequentially, and will either
accept the object for asynchronous publishing, or reject it. If a filter rejects an object, filters processing will be
stopped, and the object will be published synchronously.

Implementation: extend eZAsynchronousPublishingFilter
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In order to implement a filter, you must create a class that extends the ``eZAsynchronousPublishingFilter`` abstract class.
This class implements the ``eZAsynchronousPublishingFilterInterface`` interface, and enforces the definition of the ``accept()``
method. The ``accept()`` method must return a boolean. True means the object can be published asynchronously, while false
instructs the system to skip the asynchronous publishing feature, and publish the content directly.

The abstract class provides you with the ``eZContentObjectVersion`` being published, as the ``$version`` class property. From
this property, you can easily test the content object's property (publishing time, author, content class, section), read
attributes, and so on.

Example::

    <?php
    /**
     * Exclude from asynchronous publishing any object that isn't an article
     * @return bool
     */
    class eZAsynchronousPublishingClassFilter extends eZAsynchronousPublishingFilter
    {
        public function accept()
        {
            $contentObject = $this->version->contentObject();
            return in_array( $contentObject->attribute( 'class_identifier' ), $this->validClasses );
        }

        private $validClasses = array( 'article' );
    }
    ?>

The class above will only publish asynchronously objects of class article.

Settings
''''''''

Each filter must be registered using INI settings from content.ini. Below is an example for the class filtering class
above::

    [PublishingSettings]
    AsynchronousPublishingFilters[]=eZAsynchronousPublishingClassFilter

One line similar to the one above must be added for each filter.
